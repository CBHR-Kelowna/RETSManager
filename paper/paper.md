# Summary

RETS-Manager is a Django based platform retrieving for retrieving, storing, and syncing real-estate data and images from multiple listing service (MLS) servers. This platform was designed based on the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) Data Distribution Facility (DDFÂ®) payload structure and can be easily modified to support any other MLS server. The platform converts the raw XML data of the MLS servers to a structure data in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database. It also supports storing media files either locally or on AWS S3 bucket. Additionally, the platform is ready for deployment as a Docker Container and it supports fully automation scheduled tasks using Redis and Celery.    This end-to-end solution for real-estate data can be used by researchers to obtain a clean structured data for research related to housing prices trends, predictions and statistics. Also, it can be used as a backend for real-estate websites

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$
